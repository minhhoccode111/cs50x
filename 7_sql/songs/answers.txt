If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
- By counting number of songs of a specific artist to determind that user is more likely to listen to that artist
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
- Should create another table to keep track of every time user listen to a specific song or artist
